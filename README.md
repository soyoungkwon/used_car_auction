1. To structurize the CSV file (inspections.. has json structure --> to normal pandas columns)
2. Combine two files (inspections.csv, auctions.csv) --> too large to upload the result, but preprocessing ipynb file does the work
3. Create Machine Learning algorithms to 1) predict return rate, 2) predict price of the car
